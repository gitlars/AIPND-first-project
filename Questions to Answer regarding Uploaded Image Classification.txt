Questions to Answer regarding Uploaded Image Classification

Once the program stops running and the results files appear in the workspace, open and review each of the three to answer the following questions:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.
 
	Yes, all three model architectures classified Dog_01.jpg as "norwegian elkhound, elkhound", although the image was of an Akita.

2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

	Yes, all three model architectures classified Dog_02.jpg also as "norwegian elkhound, elkhound", although the image was of an Akita.

3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

	Yes, all three model architectures correctly classified "Short-beaked_Echidna_01.jpg" as an echidna. Interestingly, the modifier "Short-beaked" was not picked up (I speculate it was because of the hyphenated word). Also, all three model architectures correctly classified "Teapot_01.jpg" as a teapot.

4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

	All three model architectures produced identical classification results. They all incorrectly classified the Akita images as a Norwegian Elkhound. The alexnet architecture was the fastest of the three in producing these results.
